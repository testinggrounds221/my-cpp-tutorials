The word polymorphism means having many forms.
In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.
Polymorphism is considered as one of the important features of Object Oriented Programming.

In C++ polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:

1) Compile time Polymorphism
2) Runtime polymorphism

1) Compile time polymorphism: This type of polymorphism takes place at compile time and is also known as static binding or early binding.
Compile time polymorphism can be achieved by - 
	a) Function overloading
	b) Operator overloading
	c) Templates

2) Runtime polymorphism: 
This type of polymorphism takes place during the runtime and is also known as dynamic binding or late binding.
Runtime polymorphism can be achieved by - 
	a) Function overriding
